# CSUP-Data-Visualization

Multiple chart views which show data from RTEPMS (Real-Time Environmental Parameters Monitoring System)

### Project Overview

This project chart views which contain  Air, Wind and Rainfall information. These information are generated when a user submits date from a date picker form. For wind user can choose between Average Wind Speed, Maximum Wind Speed, Wind Direction option by using "select form". The same thing can be done for Air user can choose between Air Temperature, Air Humidity, Air Pressure and for Rainfall Rainfall (1h) Rainfall (24h). To select between Air, Wind and Rainfall information, a button will be displayed which will redirect to the chosen Page. For the back end data will be retrieved using API endpoint. Data will be manipulated using the user inputs which will be subbmited using a form and will be shown in a chart view. Some restrictions will be implied for the date picker (ex. new_date cannot be greater than last_date ) etc.The front end of this project will be simple but nice looking for the users.
